## About

This is the client part of the "Feathers Messaging" app.
See [here](https://github.com/leob/feathers-messaging-server) for the server part.

This project is based on the source code from the [Quasar/Feathers tutorial](https://github.com/claustres/quasar-feathers-tutorial).
It uses [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Quasar](http://quasar-framework.org/) and [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com).

## Getting Started

Both the client and the server work best with Node 8.x or higher installed.

Install and run the server as described [here](https://github.com/leob/feathers-messaging-server).

Then install the client (this project) as follows:

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ npm run dev

# build for production with minification
$ npm run build
```
